# Justinanimelist - Next-js Project
This project is an Anime List website created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and styling using Tailwindcss. Following the video course by Dea Afrizal. The website includes features such as search, pagination, detailed anime information, login, and more. Besides following the video course, I have also made significant improvements in terms of code structure and UI/UX experience.

- **Pagination**: Enables easy navigation through search results.
- **Detailed Anime Information**: Provides detailed information about each anime.
